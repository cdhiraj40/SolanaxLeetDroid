Here are the references/resources that I used while creating this dApp and for learning SOLANA in general.
Do not get overwhelmed by seeing so many resources, try to explore which one fits for you and your needs. They all are pretty great!
Whenever I get some time I will try to rearrange them in a way so that it can help beginners even more in selecting.
